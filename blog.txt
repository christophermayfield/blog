I had a major panic attack today. I have no idea what is going on with me. I'm subbing for a half day at La Habra. I have been having MAJOR anxiety lately. I really need to figure this out. 
I'm almost off 90 minutes left to go! I"m so excited to walk around Costco and get a hotdog. Learning to code has been very fun. It's teaching me about how to make cool things and changing the world. I just need to get home and take my medication to lower my blood pressure. But I'm starting to panic for no reason I'm going to be okay. I'm feeling a bit better now. I'm working on my paper right now so that's pretty fun. Well I'm learning LaTeX, so that's a skill to have.

September 22nd

Woke up not feeling too hot. Not sure if I'll be going to see two door cinema club tonight. I had a major realization today. Is modern therapy just self obsession? Is that literally insane? I don't even know what to do now. Maybe just focus on getting healthy and learning more coding and other skills. 

September 23rd
