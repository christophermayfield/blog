It's 9/11, everyday I think about what it was like when I was in 6th grade. It was a very somber day. Doing some code work right now. It's fun to learn. The fire has made me so tired though it is horrible. I went to the gym and had some dinner, it was really good. I hate studying math, but I have to do it If I don't want to be homeless. 

September 12th

I had a major panic attack today. I have no idea what is going on with me. I'm subbing for a half day at La Habra. I have been having MAJOR anxiety lately. I really need to figure this out. 
I'm almost off 90 minutes left to go! I"m so excited to walk around Costco and get a hotdog. Learning to code has been very fun. It's teaching me about how to make cool things and changing the world. I just need to get home and take my medication to lower my blood pressure. But I'm starting to panic for no reason I'm going to be okay. I'm feeling a bit better now. I'm working on my paper right now so that's pretty fun. Well I'm learning LaTeX, so that's a skill to have. 

September 13th

I'm at work today. I went to a virtual job fair. That was pretty fun. I'm working on my paper right now so I don't have to do it at home. I haven't gotten much work done on it as much as I would like. I'm currently doing it. We went to Donut man today, that was super awesome

Today Is fight day! 

September 16th

Going back to the dentist to get my tooth checked out again. Just got back! It turns out that my tooth is looking pretty good! I'm doing some cs50 work and some HW for school tonight. I'm headed to the gym in a bit. I'm back home now. I had a big anxiety attack today. I think It has to do with my lack of work lately. I'm confident I'll get it figured out tomorrow. 


September 17th 

I'm really having bad anxiety. I'm not sure what to do. I'm just writing this to help me feel better. Might go to El Segundo today to see Isaiah talk today. Still debating on it.

I'm almost off work going to go home and do some work. I'm going to get Dave's hot chicken tonight. 


September 22nd

Woke up not feeling too hot. Not sure if I'll be going to see two door cinema club tonight. I had a major realization today. Is modern therapy just self obsession? Is that literally insane? I don't even know what to do now. Maybe just focus on getting healthy and learning more coding and other skills. 

September 23rd

Woah I had another anxiety attack today. I'm not entirely sure what is going on with me. I'm just going to keep working on myself and getting better. Its all I can do at this point really. I'm just doing more work at the moment. I'm going to eat a chomp for lunch and that will be a nice relaxing break. 

September 24th

I didn't sleep very well last night, but we are going to get a lot of work done today. I need to get my paper done, some work done with the BSF lesson, and write some code. I'm going to get the paper stuff done first. Having more anxiety, relax Chris, relax. Okay, I'm feeling better now, let's get back to work. I just ate lunch, now back to work. Got a section done.

Still working till I get off. Off in 5. I'm so hungry idk why I ate 3 slices of pizza today.

September 30th 

Slow on the start today, but I have a half-day at chino today. My stomach is still bugging me. At work now, hopefully I can get through it. I'm not feeling it today at all. Luckily there's a co teacher for the next two periods. It's almost lunch time thank the lord. One more hour! LFG. Life is hard, but I have to remember that no one is coming to save me. It's all on me. I'm back home. Stomach is still hurting but we're gonna get past this...hopefully. Doing homework now. Finished this assignment. Headed to bed to watch some TV. 


October 1st 

Today I'm working a half day over at Troy. Still pretty tired but I'm hopefully going to have the energy to get that done later. At Fullerton, about to walk over in a bit. Finally home. About to do some code work.

October 9th 

Just got to La Vista. Today, I'm going to finish my assignment and work on some coding work that I need to get done. 

October 10th 

Just got to La Habra. Going to La Habra bowl in a bit to do some cleaning and such. I need to get some other work done for my other class. We are almost out. I have a flareup at work today. My body is really hurting bad, must be the flareup. Going home in about 15 minutes, which is exciting. 

October 11th 

Am I going on a date tonight?! Hopefully she gets back to me from yesterday. :( Worst case I just do something else I guess. Not a big deal. Feelings of insecurity keep creeping back in. I need to remind myself that This isn't my fault it's just situational. If it's God's plan, then that is what it is. I just need to be faithful to myself. And the others around me. Why is it so hard for me to get past that. I guess I just really like her. It's frustrating when I feel like she doesn't feel that same. Maybe I just need to get over myself and my insecurities a bit. Idk if she deleted her profile or if she blocked me it's hard to tell. The initial interest is there at least. I hope that doesn't fade over time. I just need to lock in and get over myself a bit. I'm dealing with a situation at work right now so I need to get that figured out first. I'm working on cutting weight right now. I'm down a few pounds I'm excited to eat some lunch though. Not sure what I'm going to get. I might go home and eat since I have a good amount of time. Why do I feel like I'm not being valued? It's a very legitimate reason. I need to not take it personally when it's probably not. I just don't know how to go forward with her. She seems interested a bit. I don't want to keep getting in my head. I sent her a message. Check back with the results, I'm nervous. 

October 13th

Well guys, I never heard back from her. 

October 14th 

I wonder what happened? 

October 15th

Just curious, never heard back. What do we think happened? Would have been really nice to know honestly. I'll just have to accept that. I'm definitely going to. I really wanted to meet her, but that's okay I guess.

October 16th

I'm getting past that. There's things in my life that I'm trying to get better at not taking things personally. 

October 17th

I'm fully past it now. 

October 19th

We're starting to feel better. 

October 20th 

I'm totally there now! It feels good to be past the ghosting. Why can't I literally finish this assignment. I have no idea what is going on with me right now lol. I'm trying to finish this on time. Trying my best to finish this.

October 21st

Working a long day tomorrow at La Habra. Not exactly looking forward to it, but that's okay. Trying to play some poker tonight. 

October 22nd

Long day today. Going to try to grind out as much work as possible. Going to grind this out today. No Fibro feeling today, which is awesome. Taking a short break, then back to work. Okay back to work. Finished the assignment. Now I'm going to do more work. Taking a 5 minute break

October 23rd 

Doing some AI research today. Did some reading and going to do some HW tomorrow. 

October 24th 

I am so tired, Idk what is wrong with me honestly. I think I need to figure this out. I'm going to do som research on this. 


October 25th 

Today is escape! I'm not sure if I'm going to go today. Might go one day depending on how I feel. I might go but I'm so tired and my body hurts bad right now. I'm also having panic attacks. But I need to realize that nobody is looking out for me in that sense. Nobody is coming. Remember that, Chris. I wish my foot wasn't hurting so bad I do want to go today. I'll figure it out later. 


October 26th

Traffic isn't as bad today. Leaving soon. 

October 27th

What an event! Super fun it was nice to see some people. 

October 28th 

Slept decently well. At work today, should be a chill day. Getting some writing done. I've been a bit of a mental distraction today. I need to lock in better. 

October 29th 

Slept better today. 

October 30th 

Tomorrow is the last day of the month! Let's fucking go! 

October 31st 

Today is Halloween! 

Happy November 1st! We gotta get strong for the new year! Lots of exciting things down the pike!I'm trying to drop weight as well. Going to do some math right now. 

November 4th 

Big gap here, but we are going to get back into it! I'm pretty mad at myself that I messed up the previous work, but that's okay truly. I'm getting back into the thick of it. I don't know how passionate I am about therapy, but I want to learn more about compute and how AI works. I still have time so I can make it work. I need to believe in myself. My future self will thank me. I need to write some code today. Why can't I focus in this class.


November 5th 

I'm in such a bad mood because they didn't want to give me that job. Fuck them. I'll get over it soon. 

November 6th 

The election is over. 

November 8th 

I've been dealing with a lot of pain lately. I'm hoping that it goes away soon. I'm looking into seeing a functional medical doctor for my general health. I want to generate a health plan to make myself live for as long as possible. I really need to look into how to make sure my health gets better. I'm going to get sushi for dinner tonight. I'm very excited. Maybe I'll get KBBQ. I'm. Not entirely sure yet. I'm going to run home and grab something to eat and take some pain medicine. 

November 9th 

Today, I'm going to a concert tonight! It going to be very fun! 

November 10th 

I'm going to play a poker tournament and do some coding work. Right now, I'm learning some Math because Math is kinda cool to learn. I raised OOP in a 76 board it was pretty awesome. I just got eliminated.

November 12th 

I've had the flu for the past couple of days. Just trying to recover and get over this. I want to get back onto the horse. Being sick is literally the worst.

November 13th 

Still a bit sick, trying to get over this and get back on the wagon again because I truly miss it. I miss being healthy and happy. Nobody deserves to be sick. America needs to back its people. I think that RFK will do his best to make America healthy again. 

November 14th 

I'm starting to get upset with how I'm not 100% better yet. What is wrong with me?! Ugh not good. 

November 15th 

At work today for the first time this week. Tired, but it feels good to be back. I just got back work. I feel pretty disgusting honestly. Idk what I need to do to get better. I need to not get so stressed out about this. 

November 17th 

Today I'm feeling a bit better. I'm going to do some Math and other HW. I'm also going to some coding, but idk why I'm having issues focusing with my eyes. I'm back home now after going to the gym. 

November 18th

I think I'm back to feeling near 100% better! This is so great honestly. But what I also don't get is why am I having eye strain. What do I need to do now to not focus on this eye strain. Now that we are running out of time for the new year, I want to figure out what the next move is going to be. I also want to know how to focus better on my new work. I also want to focus on my health this year. I want to get better at coding. (Fuck I'm going to have a busy year next year). I'm also watching the pyro video about 

November 19th 

Today I'm doing a day off of work (well no work) and going to do some things at home. Primarily work on some coding projects and admin stuff that I need to get done during the day. I'm trying to figure out what else I want to do besides Therapy in my life. I'm assuming that therapy will be around (for at least a while) in most parts of my life. But What I'm focusing on now is more technical skills, well getting those skills up in order to create a life for myself. 

To do list today: 
1. Finish FA for the new year
2. Calculus 3 work 
3. Start new class work.

November 21st 

Today, I'm going to do some math and study work. 

November 22nd

Checking what I need to do today. I'm going to finish my paper first. Idk why I'm having such bad anxiety lately. What is going on with me? I want to figure this out. I haven't been able to get much work done, which has been annoying. I'm going to try to finish this assignment today. Locking in for the last 20 minutes. 8 minutes left till I'm free for a week.


November 24th 

We back at it again boys. I'm doing some research tonight on my little pony. Bronies are very interesting group of people. 

November 25th 

Happy Monday today boys! Been cleaning all day today. It's time to work. I'm tired of cleaning I'm gassed ugh lol. I'm going to clean a bit later after I eat some food :) Just ate some yummy dinner :) 

November 26th 

I did some cleaning tonight (it's 12:06AM as I write this) it went incredibly well. Now I'm awake. It's 1pm and I'm so tired. Idk what's wrong with me today. I need to lock in my diet. I'm eating absolutely horribly lately. I'm so annoyed with what's going on with me lately. It has to be the food that I'm eating. I'm going to drop off a package then do some studying later. I need to update my machine. I'm going to close out some tabs and then go to the gym. Doing BSF now. Almost done. I'm back from the gym and now I'm going to shower. 

November 27th 

Checking in.

November 28th 

Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Enjoy eating amazing Turkey!! I just ate it! So delicious. I'm trying to make some memes.

November 30th

I'm back on the grind! Trying to finish up this assignment today. I'm going to start in about 20 minutes! Now I'm starting! Hopefully I get this done before the kings game. Now I'm getting a phone call. I just wrote a few paragraphs. I've been having a good week off. I wasn't able to get as much done as I would have hoped, but it helps to have the rest. I'm going to attack more of these books during Christmas break. Just started doing some work.

December 1st 

Happy December everyone! 30 more days left in the year! I hope to lose at least 8 pounds by the end of the year. I really need to get off this BD medication as quick as possible. My goal with this is to eat primarily fruit and veggies and probably follow Bryan Johnson's blueprint as much as possible. I finished the assignment (first one) so that is good. Now the second one is done! I don't know why this was hard for myself. Idk what I want to do with my life. Do I want to continue to be a therapist? Or do I want to do something else? I really don't know. Why can't I figure this out?! I really just need to try things out and see if I like them or not. Is following your passion a good thing? I really need to listen to the book the Algebra of wealth. I REALLY. Need to figure this out. I'm optimistic in myself. My mom believes in me and so do the people in my life. 


December 2nd 

Only 30 more days till 2025! Let's finish off this year strong! Just got my time sheet in for September, that's getting processed. Going to go home and get some fruit like some raspberries and apples and lay in bed. That sounds good. I'm feeling pretty crappy I'll probably call off tomorrow and use my sick pay. I'll need to get a doctor's note, but I can do that when I get home from work. I am home now. 

December 3rd 

Called off and took a sick day today. I'm hungry. I just went to get a gift for a friend and I'm finishing BSF work. From there, I"m going to have the meeting and lay down, I'm not feeling too hot. I'll feel better soon (hopefully). I'm in bible study right now. This is fun. It's a good lesson. Done now!

December 4th 
Happy December 4th! Hope everyone is doing well. I messed up at work today but what are you going to do. I lost my key at work, but she wasn't too mad at me about it. It caused me to get massive Diarrhea :( It's gotten better since then. I'm not going to eat until later tonight. My cat is dying :) I got to pet him for a few minutes, but it was hard doing that. I miss him already. 

December 5th
Dyson was doing a bit better today. He was doing a lot better today. He was kind of coming out the garage a bit more, which is awesome. Maybe he isn't tired and isn't hurting as much. I'm praying that he is doing better. 

December 6th
Dyson was actually a bit better today. He was hanging with my mom which is awesome! I'm going to finish my assignment today.


December 7th 
Dyson is still in the garage, but he seems to be comfortable. He is eating and drinking. I guess if he wants to be in the garage that's okay with me. 

December 8th 
Starting my homework. I have been having trouble starting it today. I think it has to do with my ADHD. I have been thinking about starting medication for it, but I really don't want to.  I finished my homework. I think I need to create time where I only do the work that I need to. I'm going to go to bed in a little bit. Idk why I'm always panicking now. I'm trying to eat 

December 9th 
Just at the mall until work starts. I'm going to get some gas on the way over also. I'll probably sit here for about 20 minutes or so.  I just got to the school I'm working a 2 hour job but it pays 3 periods, so that's nice. I'm off in an hour so that's great for me today. I'm home now! Going to do some work. Didn't get much done. I'm writing some code right now. 

December 10th 
At work until 11:55 today. I'm collabing right now. She is a very nice teacher. I just did some work to make a few extra dollars. Idk if she's going to be here the rest of the day or not. I might work it.
