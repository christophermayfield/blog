My stomach has been hurting a bunch. Going to try the BRAT diet and see how that works. Not sure entirely, but we'll see. I'll stay confident that nothing is wrong. I'll be checking and watching. Probably write a report on how I'm doing. We'll see. Worked on my presentation and now I'm doing some math now.
